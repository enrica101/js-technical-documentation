This is a JavaScript Technical Documentation that contains the JavaScript syntax and declaration forms. The documentation is not complete and is only made this for the project challenge of freeCodeCamp. I set the side nav on fixed so it wouldn't scroll down together with the main section. I customized the scrollbars for additional styling. I used very little JS for the toggle icon menu for smaller screen views, so it is responsive. 

My problem:
I wasn't able to fully fix the menu bar icon, which only appears when the screen is on smaller devices. It scrolls down together with the navbar and is over the text which looks kinda messy.
